Write a program which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of given _a_ and _b_ (0 < _a, b_ ≤ 2,000,000,000). You can supporse that LCM(a, b) ≤ 2,000,000,000.

## Input

Input consists of several data sets. Each data set contains _a_ and _b_ separated by a single space in a line. The input terminates with EOF.

## Output

For each data set, print GCD and LCM separated by a single space in a line.

## Sample Input

8 6 50000000 30000000
## Output for the Sample Input

2 24 10000000 150000000
