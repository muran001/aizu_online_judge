Write a program which computes the digit number of sum of two integers _a_ and _b_

## Input

There are several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integers _a_ and _b_ which are separeted by a space in a line. The input terminates with EOF.

## Constraints

- 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000000
- The number of datasets ≤ 200

## Output

Print the number of digits of _a_ + _b_ for each data set.

## Sample Input

5 7 1 99 1000 999
## Output for the Sample Input

2 3 4
