Write a program which solve a simultaneous equation:

ax + by = c dx + ey = f

The program should print x and y for given a, b, c, d, e and f(-1000 ≤ a, b, c, d, e, f ≤ 1000). You can suppose that given equation has a unique solution.

## Input

The input consists of several data sets, 1 line for each data set. In a data set, there will be a, b, c, d, e, f separated by a single space. The input terminates with EOF.

## Output

For each data set, print x and y separated by a single space. Print the solution to three places of decimals. Round off the solution to three decimal places.

## Sample Input

1 2 3 4 5 6 2 -1 -2 -1 -1 -5
## Output for the Sample Input

-1.000 2.000 1.000 4.000
## Hint

try it

2 -1 -3 1 -1 -3 2 -1 -3 -9 9 27

output should be

0.000 3.000 0.000 3.000
